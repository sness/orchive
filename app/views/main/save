<p>The Orchive is a project to digitize approximately 20,000 hours of
Orca song, recorded by the 



a Orca research project with it's main base located on Hanson Island,
a small island off the north end of Vancouver Island.
</p>



<p>
The Orchive is in the process of creating a large digital archive
of killer whale or orca vocalizations. The goal of the project is to
digitize approximately 20000 hours of existing analog recordings of
these vocalizations in order to facilitate access to researchers
internationally. </p>

<p>We are also developing tools to assist content-based
a ccess and retrieval over this large digital audio archive. After
describing the logistics of the digitization process we describe
algorithms for denoising the vocalizations and for segmenting the
recordings into regions of inter est. It is our hope that the creation
of this archive and the associated tools will lead to better
understanding of the acoustic communications of Orca communities
worldwide.

<p>The fish eating killer whales or orcas, Orcinus Orca, that are the
focus of this project live in the coastal waters of the northeastern
Pacific Ocean. They are termed residents and live in the most stable
groups documented among mammals. Resident orcas emit a variety of
vocalizations including echolocation clicks, tonal whistles, and
pulsed calls (Ford et al., 2000).</p>

<p> The Northern Resident Community consists of more than 200
individually known orcas in three acoustic clans. It is regularly
found in the study area of the Johnstone Strait and the adjacent
waters off Vancouver Island, British Columbia from July to
October. 


    </div>
  </div>



<p>The goal of the Orchive project is to digitize acoustic data
that have been collected over a period of 36 years using a variety of
analog media at the research station OrcaLab (http://www.orcalab.org)
on Hanson Island which is located centrally in the study area. </p>


<p>Currently we have approximately 20000 hours of analog recordings
mostly in high quality audio cassettes. In addition to the
digitization effort which is underway we are developing algorithms and
software tools to facilitate access and retrieval to this large audio
collection. The size of this collection makes access and retrieval
especially challenging (for example it would take approximately 2.2
years of continuous listening to cover the entire archive). Therefore
the developed algorithms and tools are essential for effective long
term studies employing acoustic techniques.</p>


<%= image_tag "spacers/spacer-tail-right.png", :class => "spacer" %>

<p> This project is just beginning but we believe it provides many
opportunities and challenges related to large scale semantic access in
a non-typical application scenario. We are looking forward to
receiving feedback from other researchers in information access and
retrieval regarding this project. The people involved in the project
are all volunteers and the software developed is open source. We
welcome help and contributions from any interested parties. Finally we
hope that in the future researchers from around the world will be able
to access this repository and use the developed tools to improve
understanding of acoustic communication of orcas.</p>
